Kafka Spike
===
A simple experiment for getting my head around Kafka and the associated ecosystem.

Start my looking at the `Application` class to see the absolute basics of setting up a Kafka Stream.

Take a look at `EmbeddedKafkaTest` to see how we can use Embedded Kafka to perform some simple unit testing using a real
Kafka instance.
